-- by Khurram Ali Jaffery

-- Main Components:
-- minimax algorithm
-- a board evaluator
-- state search
-- movement generators (and by extension, tree generator, new state generator)
-- crusher
-- custom data types (already done)

-- Piece is a data representation of possible pieces on a board
-- where D is an empty spot on the board
--		 W is a piece of the White player
--		 B is a piece of the Black player
--

data Piece = D | W | B deriving (Eq, Show)

--
-- Point is a tuple of 2 elements
-- representing a point on a grid system
-- where the first element represents the x coordinate
--       the second element represents the y coordinate
--

type Point = (Int, Int)

--
-- Tile is a tuple of 2 elements 
-- representing what a point is occupied by
-- where the first element represents a piece 
--       the second element represents a point
--

type Tile  = (Piece, Point)

--
-- Board is a list of Pieces, thus it is an internal representation
-- of the provided string representation of the board, it maintains
-- the same order as the string representation of the board
--

type Board = [Piece]

--
-- Grid is a list of Points, thus it is an internal representation
-- of the hexagonal grid system translated into a coordinate 
-- system to easily maintain and make moves on the board
--

type Grid = [Point]

--
-- State is a list of Tile, thus it is an internal representation precisely
-- for the purposes of zipping the board and the grid together in order
-- to keep easier track of the effects on the pieces of making moves on grid
--

type State = [Tile]

--
-- Next is a data representation for storing and passing around information within
-- the tree generating function, allowing it to correctly generate new children
-- 
-- Next consists of 4 elements
-- where usedDepth is an integer reprsenting the current depth level
--		 newBoard is the next board to add to the tree
-- 		 seenBoards is the updated history to avoid possible future trouble boards
-- 		 cplayer is the current player for whom the board was generated for
--

data Next a = Next {usedDepth :: Int, newBoard :: a, seenBoards :: [a], cplayer :: Piece}

--
-- Tree is a data representation for the search tree, it is an extention of 
-- the rose tree widely used for implementing such unequally branched search trees
--
-- Tree consists of 3 elements
-- where depth is an integer representing the depth level of the node
-- 		 board is the game state at that node
-- 		 nextBoards are the child nodes of the current node
--

data Tree a = Node {depth :: Int, board :: a, nextBoards :: [Tree a]} deriving (Show)

--
-- BoardTree is the internal representation of the search tree of the given board
-- that is to be generatated for correctly implementing the minimax algorithm.
--

type BoardTree = Tree Board

--
-- Slide is a tuple of 2 elements
-- an internal representation of a slide
-- where the first element represents the point to move from
-- 		 the second element represents the adjacent point to move to
--

type Slide = (Point,Point)

--
-- Jump is a tuple of 2 elements
-- an internal representation of a leap
-- where the first element represents the point to move from
-- 		 the second element represents the adjacent point to move over
--		 the third element represents the point to move to
--

type Jump = (Point,Point,Point)

--
-- Move is a tuple of 2 elements
-- an internal representation of a move
-- where the first element represents the point to move from
-- 		 the second element represents the point to move to
--
-- Note: in essence it is the same as a slide however the idea
--		 is that a jump can be reduced to a move as in effect 
--		 nothing happens the point moved over in a jump
--

type Move = (Point,Point)
